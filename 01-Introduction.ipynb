    "I, like most people, enjoy watching a good movie. Of course \"good\" is based off of individual preference. I almost always base by decision on if I want to watch a movie or not on the movies' genre, for example I tend to shy away from rom-coms. I can pretty much tell with 100% accuracy the genre of a movie just based on the title, the poster and some details about the movie such as director and actors. This led me to wonder how accurate a computer could be in predicting the genre of a movie based on these same data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I am looking at movie metadata, ranging from actors and directors to movie posters, in order form a machine learning model to predict movie genre. I hypothesize that there will be a number of extremely important factors that will assist me in making this model quite accurate. For example, the primary colors of the movie poster will likely heavily correlate to the genre, blues and greens for children's movies, red and black for horror, etc."
